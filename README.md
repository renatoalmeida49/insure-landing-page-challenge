## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learn a new way to organize all my CSS files. This makes my code really well organized.

### Continued development

I need to use SCSS. I thing I made a really good step foward with this organization, but the SCSS would be better.
